## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to project directory: `cd /app/projects/aze-gemini`
2. Ensure GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated: `gh auth status`
3. Preview commands: `./gh-commands-preview.sh`
4. Create all issues: `./create-github-issues.sh`

### Prerequisites
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Write access to the GitHub repository
- Milestones created in GitHub repository
- All markdown files present in `github-issues/` directory

### Customization Required
Before execution, update:
- Replace `@assignee-placeholder` with actual GitHub usernames
- Verify milestone names match your GitHub repository
- Adjust labels if needed for your project conventions

## File Verification

All required files are present:
- ✅ Main script: `create-github-issues.sh` (executable)
- ✅ Preview script: `gh-commands-preview.sh` (executable)  
- ✅ Documentation: `github-issues-scripts-README.md`
- ✅ All 20 issue markdown files in `github-issues/` directory
- ✅ Issue #001 marked as resolved (will be skipped)

## Expected Results

After successful execution:
- 19 new GitHub issues created
- Issues properly labeled and assigned to milestones
- Detailed descriptions from markdown files included
- Issues organized by priority and implementation phase
- Project ready for development team assignment and work

## Notes

- Issue #001 (FTP Deployment Authentication) is already resolved and will be skipped
- All issues include detailed implementation steps, acceptance criteria, and success metrics
- Total estimated effort: 100+ weeks with parallel development across teams
- Scripts are ready to run when GitHub CLI access is available
