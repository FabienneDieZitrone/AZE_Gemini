## Security Improvements
1. **Authorization Fixed**: 
   - Users now only see data they're authorized to access
   - Role-based filtering implemented

2. **Privilege Escalation Blocked**:
   - Only Admin users can change roles
   - Non-admins receive 403 Forbidden

3. **Debug Files Removed**:
   - No more potential backdoors
   - No debug information exposed

## Verification Required
1. Test with different user roles:
   - Honorarkraft: Should only see own data
   - Standortleiter: Should only see location data
   - Admin: Should see all data

2. Try role change as non-admin (should fail)

3. Verify debug files are inaccessible
