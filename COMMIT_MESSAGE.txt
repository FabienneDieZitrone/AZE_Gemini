fix: Remove hardcoded credentials and add environment template

- Remove build/.env from repository (security critical)
- Add build/.env.example as configuration template
- Update .gitignore to prevent credential commits
- Add comprehensive security documentation

BREAKING CHANGE: Developers must now create their own .env file
from .env.example template. Never commit actual credentials.
