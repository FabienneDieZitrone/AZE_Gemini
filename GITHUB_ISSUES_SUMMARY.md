## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make script executable (already done)
chmod +x create-all-github-issues.sh

# Run with GitHub token
./create-all-github-issues.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Or use environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
./create-all-github-issues.sh
```

### Get GitHub Token
1. Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (private) or `public_repo` (public)
4. Copy the token

## 🔧 Script Features

### ✅ Implemented Features
- **API Authentication**: Direct GitHub API calls with curl
- **Priority Processing**: Critical issues created first
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time colored output with status updates
- **Logging**: Detailed log file creation
- **Label Extraction**: Automatic label detection from markdown files
- **Content Processing**: Full markdown content preservation
- **Rate Limiting**: API-respectful delays between requests
- **Connectivity Testing**: API access verification before processing
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart label deduplication

### 🎨 Output Features
- Color-coded console output
- Progress indicators for each issue
- Success/failure tracking
- Issue URLs displayed after creation
- Summary report with statistics

## 📋 Technical Implementation

### Label Detection Logic
The script automatically assigns labels based on:
- **Content Analysis**: Extracts labels from markdown files
- **Priority Detection**: Adds `critical` or `high-priority` based on content
- **Status Detection**: Adds `resolved` for completed issues
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate labels

### Error Handling
- GitHub API connectivity testing
- HTTP response code validation
- Detailed error messages and logging
- Graceful failure handling with continue processing

### Security Considerations
- Token security best practices documented
- No token storage in files
- Rate limiting to respect GitHub API
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
