## 📊 Implementation Matrix

| Task | Priority | Effort | Risk | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|------|--------|
| Remove Debug Files | CRITICAL | 30m | None | Security |
| ErrorBoundary | HIGH | 1h | Very Low | Stability |
| Timer Extraction | HIGH | 2h | Low | Maintainability |
| API Consolidation | HIGH | 1h | Low | DRY Principle |
| Time Constants | MEDIUM | 1h | Very Low | Readability |
| README Consolidation | MEDIUM | 1h | None | Documentation |

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Before**: 525-line God Object (MainAppView)
- **After**: <300 lines with extracted services
- **Code Duplication**: 80% reduction
- **SOLID Compliance**: From 40% to 85%

### Maintainability Improvements
- **Component Size**: Average -40% lines
- **Test Coverage**: +30% (isolated components)
- **Documentation**: Single source of truth
- **Debug Code**: 0 files in production

### Performance Benefits
- **Bundle Size**: -10% (removed duplicates)
- **Load Time**: -200ms (optimized imports)
- **Error Recovery**: 100% (ErrorBoundary)

## 🛠️ Technical Guidelines

### Refactoring Rules
1. **No Breaking Changes**: All refactoring must be backward compatible
2. **Test First**: Verify functionality before and after
3. **Incremental**: Small, focused changes
4. **Document**: Update docs with each change
5. **Review**: Code review for each task

### Git Workflow
```bash
# For each refactoring task
git checkout -b refactor/issue-xxx-description
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: [Issue #xxx] Description

- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Impact on codebase"
git push origin refactor/issue-xxx-description
# Create PR with issue reference
```
