# Issue #19 - Security Implementation Complete

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Summary
Successfully removed all hardcoded FTP passwords from the codebase and implemented a secure credential management system.

### What Was Done

1. **Removed 16 insecure deployment scripts** containing hardcoded password "Start321"
2. **Created secure deployment system** using environment variables
3. **Implemented pre-commit hooks** to prevent future credential leaks  
4. **Added comprehensive documentation** for secure deployments
5. **Updated .gitignore** to exclude sensitive files

### Security Improvements

- ‚ùå **Before**: FTP password hardcoded in multiple scripts, exposed in public GitHub repo
- ‚úÖ **After**: Credentials stored in `.env.local`, never committed to Git

### New Deployment Process

```bash
# Safe and secure
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add credentials to .env.local
./deploy-secure.sh
```
