# Issue #010: Infrastructure as Code Implementation

## Priority: HIGH ðŸ”¶

## Description
The current infrastructure is managed manually, leading to configuration drift, inconsistencies between environments, and difficulties in scaling and disaster recovery. Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will provide repeatable, version-controlled, and auditable infrastructure management.

## Problem Analysis
- Manual server configuration and deployment
- Inconsistencies between development, staging, and production
- No version control for infrastructure changes
- Difficult to reproduce environments quickly
- Manual scaling procedures are error-prone
- No audit trail for infrastructure modifications

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Operational Risk**: High - Manual processes prone to errors
- **Scalability Impact**: High - Difficult to scale infrastructure
- **Disaster Recovery**: Critical - Slow environment recreation
- **Compliance Risk**: Medium - No audit trail for changes
- **Development Velocity**: High - Slow environment provisioning

## Current Infrastructure Challenges
- Environment inconsistencies cause deployment issues
- Manual configuration takes hours/days
- No rollback mechanism for infrastructure changes
- Difficult to track what changed when issues occur
- Knowledge locked in individual team members

## Proposed Solution
Implement comprehensive Infrastructure as Code using:
1. Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
2. Ansible for configuration management
3. Docker containers for application packaging
4. GitOps workflow for infrastructure changes
5. Automated testing for infrastructure code

- [ ] Set up configuration management for different environments
- [ ] Implement secrets management (HashiCorp Vault/AWS Secrets)
- [ ] Create configuration validation and testing

### Phase 5: Container Orchestration (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Containerize applications with Docker
- [ ] Set up container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)
- [ ] Implement container image management and security
- [ ] Create container deployment pipelines
- [ ] Set up container monitoring and logging

### Phase 6: GitOps Implementation (Week 6-7)
- [ ] Implement GitOps workflow for infrastructure changes
- [ ] Set up automated infrastructure deployment
- [ ] Create infrastructure change review process

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Create infrastructure testing suite (Terratest)
- [ ] Implement compliance and security scanning
- [ ] Set up infrastructure performance testing
- [ ] Create disaster recovery testing automation
- [ ] Validate infrastructure consistency across environments

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All infrastructure defined as code and version controlled
- [ ] Environments can be provisioned from scratch in <30 minutes
- [ ] Infrastructure changes deployed through automated pipeline
- [ ] Configuration drift eliminated between environments
- [ ] Infrastructure changes are auditable and reversible
- [ ] Disaster recovery time reduced by 80%

## Technical Stack
- **Provisioning**: Terraform with AWS/Azure/GCP providers
- **Configuration**: Ansible for server configuration
- **Containers**: Docker + Kubernetes/Docker Swarm
- **State Management**: Terraform Cloud or S3 backend
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault or cloud-native solutions

## Infrastructure Modules
### Core Infrastructure
```hcl
# VPC and Networking
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  availability_zones = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  public_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.10.0/24", "10.0.20.0/24"]
}

# Application Servers
module "app_servers" {
  source = "./modules/compute"
  
  instance_count = 3
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}

# Database
module "database" {
  source = "./modules/rds"
  
  engine = "mysql"
  instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
}
```

## GitOps Workflow
1. **Infrastructure Changes**: Made via pull requests
2. **Review Process**: Peer review and automated testing
3. **Plan Phase**: Terraform plan shows proposed changes
4. **Apply Phase**: Automated deployment after approval
