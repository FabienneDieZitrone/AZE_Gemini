# Issue #014: Security Incident Response Playbook

## Priority: CRITICAL ðŸ”´

## Description
The organization lacks a comprehensive security incident response plan and playbook, leaving the team unprepared to handle security breaches, data leaks, or cyber attacks effectively. A well-defined incident response plan is critical for minimizing damage, maintaining compliance, and ensuring business continuity during security incidents.

## Problem Analysis
- No documented security incident response procedures
- Unclear roles and responsibilities during security incidents
- Missing incident classification and escalation procedures
- No communication plan for security incidents
- Lack of forensic and evidence collection procedures
- No post-incident analysis and lessons learned process

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Business Risk**: Very High - Uncontrolled incidents can be catastrophic
- **Legal Risk**: High - Regulatory requirements for incident response
- **Reputation Risk**: Very High - Poor incident handling damages trust
- **Financial Risk**: Very High - Delayed response increases costs
- **Compliance Risk**: High - Many standards require incident response plans

## Current Incident Response Gaps
- No defined incident response team or roles
- No standardized incident detection and reporting
- Missing evidence collection and preservation procedures
- No communication templates for different stakeholders
- Lack of incident management and tracking tools
- No regular testing or updating of response procedures

## Proposed Solution
Develop comprehensive Security Incident Response Playbook including:
1. Incident response team structure and roles
2. Incident classification and escalation procedures
3. Step-by-step response procedures for different incident types
4. Communication templates and notification procedures
5. Evidence collection and forensic analysis guidelines

## Incident Classification System
### Severity Levels
- **Critical (P1)**: Active data breach, system compromise, business halt
- **High (P2)**: Potential data exposure, significant system impact
- **Medium (P3)**: Security policy violation, minor system impact
- **Low (P4)**: Security awareness issue, minimal impact

### Incident Types
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Malware Infection**: Virus, ransomware, or other malicious software
- **Denial of Service**: Service availability attacks
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious or negligent employee actions
- **Physical Security**: Unauthorized facility access
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, vishing, or other manipulation

## Response Procedures by Incident Type

### Data Breach Response
1. **Immediate Actions** (0-1 hour)
   - Contain the breach and stop data exfiltration
   - Preserve evidence and document the incident
   - Notify incident response team

2. **Short-term Actions** (1-24 hours)
   - Assess scope and impact of the breach
   - Identify affected individuals and data types
   - Begin legal and regulatory notification process

3. **Long-term Actions** (1-30 days)
   - Complete forensic investigation
   - Implement remediation measures
   - Provide victim notification and support

### Malware Incident Response
1. **Containment**
   - Isolate infected systems from network
   - Preserve system state for analysis
   - Identify malware type and infection vector

2. **Eradication**
   - Remove malware from affected systems
   - Patch vulnerabilities that allowed infection
   - Update security controls and signatures

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore systems from clean backups
   - Verify system integrity and functionality
   - Monitor for re-infection attempts
