# Issue #012: Database Query Performance Monitoring

## Priority: HIGH ðŸ”¶

## Description
The application lacks comprehensive database query performance monitoring, making it difficult to identify slow queries, optimize database performance, and prevent performance degradation. Implementing query performance monitoring will help maintain optimal database performance and user experience.

## Problem Analysis
- No visibility into slow or expensive database queries
- Missing query execution time tracking
- No index usage analysis or optimization
- Lack of query plan analysis and optimization
- No database performance trending or alerts
- Manual query optimization is reactive, not proactive

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Performance Impact**: High - Slow queries affect application response time
- **User Experience**: High - Database bottlenecks cause poor UX
- **Scalability**: High - Unoptimized queries prevent scaling
- **Infrastructure Cost**: Medium - Inefficient queries increase server load
- **Maintenance**: High - Difficult to identify and fix performance issues

## Current Database Issues
- Average query response time: 200-500ms (target: <50ms)
- Some queries taking >2 seconds to execute
- Database CPU utilization spikes to 90%+
- No visibility into which queries are causing problems
- Index usage is not monitored or optimized

## Proposed Solution
Implement comprehensive database query performance monitoring:
1. Query execution time tracking and alerting
2. Slow query log analysis and optimization
3. Index usage monitoring and recommendations
4. Query plan analysis and optimization
5. Database performance dashboards and reporting

## Query Performance Monitoring Stack

### MySQL Monitoring
```sql
-- Enable slow query log
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 0.1;
SET GLOBAL log_queries_not_using_indexes = 'ON';

-- Performance Schema monitoring
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY avg_timer_wait DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### PostgreSQL Monitoring
```sql
-- Enable query statistics
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
pg_stat_statements.track = all
log_min_duration_statement = 100

-- Analyze slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Application-Level Monitoring
```javascript
// Express.js middleware for query timing
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    logger.info('Database query completed', {
      query: req.query,
      duration: duration,
      status: res.statusCode
    });
  });
  next();
});
```

## Performance Thresholds and Alerts
- **Slow Query Threshold**: >100ms execution time
- **Critical Query Threshold**: >1000ms execution time
- **High CPU Alert**: Database CPU >80% for 5 minutes
- **Connection Pool Alert**: >90% connections in use
- **Index Usage Alert**: Table scans >1000/hour

## Monitoring Metrics
### Query Performance
- Query execution time (average, p95, p99)
- Queries per second (QPS)
- Slow query count and frequency
- Query plan changes and efficiency

### Database Health
- CPU and memory utilization
- Disk I/O and storage usage
- Connection pool utilization
- Lock wait time and deadlocks

### Index Performance
- Index hit ratio
- Index usage statistics
- Missing index recommendations
- Index maintenance overhead

## Database Optimization Strategies
### Query Optimization
- Add appropriate indexes for frequent queries
- Rewrite inefficient queries
- Implement query result caching
- Optimize JOIN operations and subqueries

### Schema Optimization
- Normalize/denormalize based on usage patterns
- Optimize data types and column sizes
