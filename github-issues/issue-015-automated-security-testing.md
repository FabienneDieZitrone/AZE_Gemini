# Issue #015: Automated Security Testing Suite

## Priority: HIGH ðŸ”¶

## Description
The application lacks comprehensive automated security testing, creating risks of deploying vulnerable code to production. Implementing an automated security testing suite will ensure continuous security validation throughout the development lifecycle and prevent security vulnerabilities from reaching users.

## Problem Analysis
- No automated security testing in development workflow
- Security vulnerabilities discovered only after deployment
- Manual security testing is inconsistent and incomplete
- No regression testing for previously fixed security issues
- Missing security testing for different layers (application, infrastructure, dependencies)
- Lack of security testing integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Security Risk**: High - Vulnerable code may reach production
- **Development Velocity**: Medium - Security issues found late are expensive
- **Compliance Risk**: Medium - Automated testing demonstrates due diligence
- **Business Risk**: High - Security breaches can be costly and damaging
- **Quality Assurance**: High - Improves overall security posture

## Current Security Testing Gaps
- No static application security testing (SAST)
- Missing dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- No interactive application security testing (IAST)
- Dependency vulnerabilities not automatically detected
- Infrastructure security not validated automatically
- API security testing not implemented

## Proposed Solution
Implement comprehensive automated security testing suite covering:
1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
