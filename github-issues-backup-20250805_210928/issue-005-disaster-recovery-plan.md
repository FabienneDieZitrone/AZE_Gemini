# Issue #005: No Disaster Recovery Plan

## Priority: CRITICAL ðŸ”´

## Description
The application lacks a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, leaving the organization vulnerable to extended downtime, data loss, and business disruption in case of system failures, security incidents, or natural disasters.

## Problem Analysis
- No documented disaster recovery procedures
- Missing business continuity planning
- No tested recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Unknown recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Lack of failover mechanisms
- No incident response procedures
- Missing communication protocols during disasters

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Business Impact**: Very High - Extended downtime could be catastrophic
- **Financial Impact**: Very High - Revenue loss during outages
- **Reputation Risk**: High - Customer trust and brand damage
- **Compliance Risk**: High - May violate regulatory requirements
- **Operational Impact**: Very High - No clear recovery procedures

## Current Vulnerabilities
- Single point of failure in infrastructure
- No backup systems or failover capabilities
- Undefined recovery priorities
- Untested recovery procedures
- No disaster communication plan

## Proposed Solution
Develop and implement comprehensive disaster recovery plan including:
1. Business impact analysis and recovery priorities
2. Detailed recovery procedures and runbooks
3. Backup systems and failover mechanisms
4. Regular disaster recovery testing
5. Incident communication protocols

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Business Impact Analysis (Week 1)
- [ ] Identify critical business functions and systems
- [ ] Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) for each system
- [ ] Define Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for data
- [ ] Assess financial impact of downtime
- [ ] Prioritize recovery sequence

### Phase 2: Technical Recovery Planning (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Document current system architecture
- [ ] Identify single points of failure
- [ ] Design backup and failover systems
- [ ] Create detailed recovery procedures
- [ ] Develop system restoration runbooks

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Redundancy (Week 4-6)
- [ ] Implement backup server infrastructure
- [ ] Set up database replication and failover
- [ ] Configure load balancing and redundancy
- [ ] Establish offsite backup systems
- [ ] Create network failover capabilities

### Phase 4: Communication and Procedures (Week 7)
- [ ] Develop incident communication plan
- [ ] Create emergency contact procedures
- [ ] Establish customer communication templates
- [ ] Define escalation procedures
- [ ] Document vendor contact information

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Week 8-9)
- [ ] Conduct tabletop disaster recovery exercises
- [ ] Perform technical recovery testing
- [ ] Validate backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Test communication protocols
- [ ] Document lessons learned and improvements

### Phase 6: Training and Documentation (Week 10)
- [ ] Train team on disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Create disaster recovery playbooks
- [ ] Establish regular review and update schedule
- [ ] Document roles and responsibilities
- [ ] Create quick reference guides

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive disaster recovery plan documented
- [ ] RTO and RPO objectives defined and achievable
- [ ] Backup systems and failover mechanisms operational
- [ ] Recovery procedures tested and validated
- [ ] Team trained on disaster recovery protocols
- [ ] Regular testing schedule established

## Recovery Time Objectives (Target)
- **Critical Systems**: RTO â‰¤ 2 hours
- **Important Systems**: RTO â‰¤ 8 hours
- **Standard Systems**: RTO â‰¤ 24 hours
- **Non-critical Systems**: RTO â‰¤ 72 hours

## Recovery Point Objectives (Target)
- **Financial Data**: RPO â‰¤ 15 minutes
- **User Data**: RPO â‰¤ 1 hour
- **Configuration Data**: RPO â‰¤ 4 hours
- **Log Data**: RPO â‰¤ 24 hours

## Technical Requirements
- **Backup Infrastructure**: Redundant servers and storage
- **Network**: Multiple internet connections and failover
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring
- **Communication**: Emergency notification systems
- **Documentation**: Centralized recovery procedures

## Disaster Recovery Components
### Infrastructure
- Backup data center or cloud region
- Redundant network connections
- Backup power systems
- Hardware replacement procedures

### Data Protection
- Real-time data replication
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Backup verification and testing
- Secure offsite storage

### Communication
- Emergency notification system
- Customer communication procedures
- Media response protocols
- Vendor escalation procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Disaster recovery plan covers all critical systems
2. RTO and RPO objectives are defined and achievable
3. Recovery procedures are documented and tested
4. Backup systems are operational and monitored
5. Team is trained on emergency procedures
6. Regular testing schedule is established and followed
