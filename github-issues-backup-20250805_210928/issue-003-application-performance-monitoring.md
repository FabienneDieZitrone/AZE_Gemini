# Issue #003: No Application Performance Monitoring

## Priority: HIGH ðŸ”¶

## Description
The application currently lacks comprehensive performance monitoring, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks, track user experience, and proactively address performance issues before they impact users.

## Problem Analysis
- No real-time performance metrics collection
- Missing application response time monitoring
- No database query performance tracking
- Lack of user experience metrics
- No alerting system for performance degradation
- Unable to identify performance trends over time

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Business Impact**: High - Poor performance affects user satisfaction and revenue
- **User Impact**: High - Slow loading times and poor responsiveness
- **Technical Debt**: Medium - Growing performance issues go undetected
- **Operational Impact**: High - Difficult to troubleshoot performance problems

## Proposed Solution
Implement comprehensive Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solution with:
1. Real-time performance metrics collection
2. Database query performance monitoring
3. User experience tracking
4. Automated alerting system
5. Performance trend analysis and reporting

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: APM Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Evaluate APM solutions (New Relic, DataDog, Elastic APM)
- [ ] Set up APM agent installation
- [ ] Configure basic performance metrics collection
- [ ] Establish monitoring dashboard

### Phase 2: Database Monitoring (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement database query performance tracking
- [ ] Set up slow query detection and logging
- [ ] Configure database connection pool monitoring
- [ ] Add database performance alerts

### Phase 3: Application Metrics (Week 4)
- [ ] Add response time monitoring for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement error rate tracking
- [ ] Set up throughput and concurrent user monitoring
- [ ] Configure memory and CPU utilization tracking

### Phase 4: User Experience Monitoring (Week 5)
- [ ] Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- [ ] Add page load time tracking
- [ ] Set up user interaction performance metrics
- [ ] Configure Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Phase 5: Alerting and Reporting (Week 6)
- [ ] Configure performance threshold alerts
- [ ] Set up automated incident detection
- [ ] Create performance reporting dashboards
- [ ] Implement performance trend analysis

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Real-time visibility into application performance
- [ ] Automated alerts for performance degradation
- [ ] Database query performance optimization capability
- [ ] User experience metrics tracking
- [ ] Performance trend analysis and reporting
- [ ] Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) < 5 minutes for critical issues

## Technical Requirements
- **APM Solution**: New Relic, DataDog, or Elastic APM
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance tracking
- **Frontend Monitoring**: Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- **Infrastructure**: Server monitoring integration
- **Alerting**: Slack/Email notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All critical application endpoints are monitored
2. Database performance metrics are tracked in real-time
3. User experience metrics are collected and analyzed
4. Automated alerts trigger within 5 minutes of issues
5. Performance dashboards provide actionable insights
6. Historical performance data is available for trend analysis

## Priority Level
**HIGH** - Essential for maintaining application quality

## Estimated Effort
- **Development Time**: 4-6 weeks
- **Team Size**: 2 developers + 1 DevOps engineer
- **Dependencies**: APM tool selection and procurement

## Implementation Cost
- **APM Tool Licensing**: $200-500/month (depending on solution)
- **Development Time**: 240-360 hours
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal additional costs
