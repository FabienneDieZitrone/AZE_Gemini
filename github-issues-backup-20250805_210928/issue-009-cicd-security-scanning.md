# Issue #009: CI/CD Security Scanning Integration

## Priority: HIGH üî∂

## Description
The CI/CD pipeline currently lacks integrated security scanning, allowing vulnerable code and dependencies to be deployed to production. Implementing comprehensive security scanning in the deployment pipeline will prevent security vulnerabilities from reaching production environments.

## Problem Analysis
- No automated security vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Dependencies not checked for known vulnerabilities
- Source code not analyzed for security issues
- Container images deployed without security scanning
- No license compliance checking
- Security testing is manual and inconsistent

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Security Risk**: High - Vulnerable code deployed to production
- **Compliance Risk**: Medium - May violate security standards
- **Business Impact**: High - Security breaches can be costly
- **Development Velocity**: Low impact - Automated scanning is fast

## Current Security Gaps
- Vulnerable dependencies in production
- Potential code injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure configuration deployment
- No security regression testing
- Missing security gates in deployment process

## Proposed Solution
Integrate comprehensive security scanning into CI/CD pipeline:
1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
3. Dependency vulnerability scanning
4. Container image security scanning
5. Infrastructure as Code security analysis

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: SAST Implementation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Integrate SonarQube or CodeQL for static code analysis
- [ ] Configure security rules and quality gates
- [ ] Set up automated security issue reporting
- [ ] Create security finding triage process
- [ ] Implement security metrics dashboard

### Phase 2: Dependency Scanning (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Integrate Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, or GitHub Security
- [ ] Scan package.json, composer.json, requirements.txt
- [ ] Set up automated vulnerability alerts
- [ ] Create dependency update automation
- [ ] Implement license compliance checking

### Phase 3: Container Security (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Integrate container vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Aqua, Twistlock)
- [ ] Scan base images for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement image signing and verification
- [ ] Create secure base image standards
- [ ] Set up container runtime security monitoring

### Phase 4: DAST Integration (Week 4-5)
- [ ] Integrate OWASP ZAP or similar DAST tool
- [ ] Set up automated penetration testing
- [ ] Configure API security scanning
- [ ] Create security test cases for critical paths
- [ ] Implement security regression testing

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Security (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Integrate infrastructure scanning (Checkov, tfsec)
- [ ] Scan Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- [ ] Check configuration security compliance
- [ ] Implement secret scanning (GitLeaks, TruffleHog)
- [ ] Set up infrastructure security monitoring

### Phase 6: Security Gates and Reporting (Week 6-7)
- [ ] Implement security quality gates in pipeline
- [ ] Create security reporting dashboard
- [ ] Set up security alert notifications
- [ ] Create security metrics and KPIs
- [ ] Establish security review processes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All code commits scanned for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies checked for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Container images scanned before deployment
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities block deployment pipeline
- [ ] Security metrics tracked and reported
- [ ] Zero high-severity vulnerabilities in production

## Technical Requirements
- **SAST Tools**: SonarQube, CodeQL, Checkmarx, or Veracode
- **DAST Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Enterprise, or Rapid7
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, GitHub Security
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Aqua Security, or Twistlock
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Checkov, tfsec, or Bridgecrew

## Security Scanning Pipeline
```yaml
# Example CI/CD Security Pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - sast_scan
  - dependency_scan
  - test
  - container_scan
  - dast_scan
  - security_gate
  - deploy

sast_scan:
  stage: sast_scan
  script:
    - sonar-scanner
    - codeql analyze
  allow_failure: false

dependency_scan:
  stage: dependency_scan
  script:
    - snyk test
    - npm audit
  allow_failure: false

container_scan:
  stage: container_scan
  script:
    - trivy image $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  allow_failure: false
```

## Security Quality Gates
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0 allowed
- **High Vulnerabilities**: <5 allowed with justification
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: <20 allowed
- **Code Coverage**: >80% with security tests
- **License Compliance**: 100% approved licenses

## Integration Points
### Version Control
- Pre-commit hooks for secret scanning
- Pull request security analysis
- Automated security issue creation

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Security scanning on every build
- Quality gates prevent vulnerable deployments
- Automated security reporting

### Monitoring
- Runtime security monitoring
- Vulnerability management integration
- Security metrics dashboards

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Security scanning integrated into all deployment pipelines
2. Critical and high vulnerabilities block deployments
3. Dependency vulnerabilities detected and reported
4. Container images scanned before deployment
5. Security metrics tracked and visible to team
6. Security issues automatically created and tracked

## Priority Level
**HIGH** - Essential for secure development lifecycle

## Estimated Effort
- **Development Time**: 6-7 weeks
- **Team Size**: 2 security engineers + 2 DevOps engineers
- **Dependencies**: Security tool licensing, CI/CD infrastructure

## Implementation Cost
- **Security Tools**: $5,000-15,000/year
- **Professional Services**: $10,000-20,000
- **Development Time**: 320-400 hours
- **Training**: $3,000-5,000
