# Issue #006: Implement Zero-Trust Security Architecture

## Priority: HIGH ðŸ”¶

## Description
The current security architecture relies on traditional perimeter-based security, which is insufficient for modern threats. Implementing a Zero-Trust security model will provide enhanced security by verifying every user and device, regardless of location, before granting access to systems and data.

## Problem Analysis
- Current security model assumes internal network is trusted
- Insufficient access controls and verification mechanisms
- Lack of continuous authentication and authorization
- Missing device trust verification
- No network micro-segmentation
- Inadequate monitoring of internal network traffic

## Impact Analysis
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Security Risk**: High - Vulnerable to insider threats and lateral movement
- **Compliance Impact**: Medium - May affect regulatory compliance
- **Business Impact**: Medium - Enhanced security improves customer trust
- **Operational Impact**: Medium - Requires changes to access procedures

## Zero-Trust Principles to Implement
1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Authenticate and authorize every connection
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Provide minimum required access
3. **Assume Breach**: Design systems assuming compromise
4. **Verify Explicitly**: Use multiple authentication factors
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor all access and activities

## Proposed Solution
Implement comprehensive Zero-Trust architecture including:
1. Identity and access management overhaul
2. Network micro-segmentation
3. Device trust verification
4. Continuous monitoring and analytics
5. Policy-based access controls

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Identity and Access Management (Week 1-3)
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
- [ ] Deploy single sign-on (SSO) solution
- [ ] Create role-based access control (RBAC) system
- [ ] Implement privileged access management (PAM)
- [ ] Set up identity governance and administration

### Phase 2: Network Security (Week 4-6)
- [ ] Implement network micro-segmentation
- [ ] Deploy next-generation firewalls with application awareness
- [ ] Set up network access control (NAC)
- [ ] Implement VPN with certificate-based authentication
- [ ] Create secure remote access solutions

### Phase 3: Device Security (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- [ ] Deploy mobile device management (MDM)
- [ ] Set up device compliance policies
- [ ] Implement certificate-based device authentication
- [ ] Create device inventory and risk assessment

### Phase 4: Data Protection (Week 9-10)
- [ ] Implement data loss prevention (DLP)
- [ ] Deploy data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Set up data classification and labeling
- [ ] Implement database activity monitoring
- [ ] Create data access governance policies

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Analytics (Week 11-12)
- [ ] Deploy Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- [ ] Implement User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- [ ] Set up security orchestration and automated response (SOAR)
- [ ] Create security dashboards and reporting
- [ ] Establish threat hunting capabilities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All users authenticate with MFA
- [ ] Network traffic is monitored and controlled
- [ ] Devices are verified before network access
- [ ] Data access is governed by least privilege principles
- [ ] Security incidents are detected and responded to quickly
- [ ] Compliance with security frameworks improved

## Technical Requirements
- **Identity Management**: Azure AD, Okta, or similar
- **Network Security**: Palo Alto, Fortinet, or Cisco solutions
- **Endpoint Security**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, or Microsoft Defender
- **SIEM**: Splunk, QRadar, or Azure Sentinel
- **VPN**: Zscaler, Cisco AnyConnect, or similar

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All access requests are authenticated and authorized
2. Network traffic is monitored and controlled
3. Devices must be compliant before accessing resources
4. Data access follows least privilege principles
5. Security events are logged and analyzed
6. Incident response times are reduced by 50%

## Priority Level
