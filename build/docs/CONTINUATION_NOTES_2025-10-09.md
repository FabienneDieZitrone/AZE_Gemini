# Project Continuation Notes (2025-10-09)

## Context Snapshot
- Stack: PHP API under `/api`, React/Vite frontend under `build/src` with Vite build to `/assets`.
- Auth/session: server-side PHP session (HTTP-only), CSRF middleware.
- Data: `time_entries`, `approval_requests`, `users`, `global_settings` (JSON fields).

## What We Fixed/Changed
- Approvals API
  - GET `/api/approvals.php`: Removed admin fallback for pending; preserved real status; robust sort; returns items/count/meta.
  - POST `/api/approvals.php`: Autocommit(false) issue — added explicit `begin_transaction()` + `commit()` to persist inserts.
  - PATCH unchanged (404 on non-pending is correct).
- Login Payload
  - Injects `approvalRequests` (pending only) after login; removed fallback “last 20”.
  - Adds `currentLocation` derived via IP→Location mapping.
  - Ensures `globalSettings.locations` contains “Home Office”.
  - Merges all locations used in IP mapping into the Stammliste and persists to DB (alphabetical).
- Approvals Dump
  - Fixed to not use non-existent `created_at`; sorts by `id DESC` and exposes JSON dates.
- Frontend
  - ApprovalView: Disable actions for non-pending; toggle “Ausstehend/Alle”; clear list before fetching pending.
  - Timesheet/DayDetail: Added top back button (Timesheet); widened the “Standort” column using `<colgroup>`.
  - Supervisor notifications: show once per session.
- Webroot / Deploy
  - `.htaccess`: `+SymLinksIfOwnerMatch`, `DirectoryIndex`; cache headers (index no-store, assets immutable).
  - Blank page incident: index.html referenced non-uploaded hashed JS; explicitly uploaded missing `/assets/index-*.js` to fix.

## IP → Standort
- Detection: From `CF_CONNECTING_IP` → `X_FORWARDED_FOR` (first hop) → `REMOTE_ADDR`.
- Hardcoded prefix map seeded from provided ranges (e.g. `10.49.8.` → `HAM SPA 4.OG`), with default “Home Office”.
- Admin overrides: `/api/ip-location-map.php` persists to `cache/ip-location-map.json`.
- Stammliste sync: All mapped locations are merged into `global_settings.locations` and saved (alphabetical).
- UI: Global Settings shows two linked blocks under one section: Stammliste and IP mapping.
  - Mapping accepts only names from the Stammliste (validated), sorted by location name.

## Time Entries → Standort
- Start/Stop API now enforces `location` on the row using session-detected location (or “Home Office”) regardless of DB defaults (overrides ‘Web’).
- Login payload also maps ‘Web’/empty location to current user’s detected location for display, as a visual fallback.

## Incidents + Root Causes
- UI showed empty approvals despite data: Login payload didn’t include approvals; GET had fallback masking status.
- New approvals not visible: POST lacked commit.
- Web 403/“Under Construction”: `.htaccess` used `-FollowSymLinks` on a symlinked webroot.
- Blank page: index.html referenced non-uploaded hashed JS.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
- Decide final storage for IP mapping:
  - A) DB table `ip_location_map (prefix, location)` with FK-like validation vs
  - B) JSON in `global_settings.ipLocationMap`.
  - Currently: JSON file in `cache`. UI + login logic already in place.
- Add integration tests for approvals POST→GET→PATCH and for time_entries location enforcement.
- Optional data migration: Fix older time_entries with ‘Web’ in a given date range.
- Deployment tooling: Ensure all new hashed assets are uploaded atomically with index.html.

## Verification Checklist
- Approvals
  - GET `/api/approvals.php` → `{ items, count, meta.pending }` sane; toggle “Ausstehend/Alle” works.
  - POST then GET shows new pending; PATCH approves; pending shrinks.
- Global Settings
  - Stammliste contains all mapped locations; sorted.
  - IP mapping editable; saving persists and re-populates after reload.
- Standort
  - Timer start/stop creates entries with real `location` (not ‘Web’); Day/Timesheet show widened column.
- Webroot
  - index.html + assets match; no 403; `.htaccess` OK.

## Useful Files/Endpoints
- API: `/api/approvals.php`, `/api/login.php`, `/api/approvals_dump.php`, `/api/time-entries.php`, `/api/ip-location-map.php`.
- Frontend: `src/views/ApprovalView.tsx`, `TimeSheetView.tsx`, `DayDetailView.tsx`, `GlobalSettingsView.tsx`.
- Config/Helpers: `api/security-headers.php`, `api/auth_helpers.php`, `api/DatabaseConnection.php`.

## GitHub
- Branch: `fix/approvals-workflow-2025-10-07` (pushed).
- PR: #148 (labels: bugfix/backend/frontend/release:v2025-10-07-approvals-fix; milestone created; auto-publish release workflow on merge).

## Notes
- Sessions and CSRF are active; admin-only IP mapping writes enforced.
- Locations always include “Home Office”.
- UI column widths controlled via `<colgroup>` to override auto-layout.
