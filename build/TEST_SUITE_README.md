# AZE Gemini Test Suite

## Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Using the comprehensive test runner
./run-tests.sh

# Using the simple fallback runner (no dependencies needed)
php run-tests-simple.php

# Using Composer shortcuts
composer run test-coverage
```

### Test Components Coverage

#### ✅ Security Components (90%+ coverage)
- **Authorization Middleware** - Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Rate Limiting** - DoS protection with sliding window algorithm
- **CSRF Protection** - Double-submit cookie pattern

#### ✅ API Endpoints (82%+ coverage)
- **Time Entries API** - Timer management with role-based filtering
- **Users API** - User management with Admin-only role changes

#### ✅ Validation & Utils (85%+ coverage)
- **Input Validation** - XSS, SQL injection, path traversal prevention

## Test Execution Options

### 1. Full Test Suite (Recommended)
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```
- Runs all test suites with coverage analysis
- Generates HTML coverage reports
- Checks for 80% coverage target
- Provides detailed execution summary

### 2. Simple Test Runner (No Dependencies)
```bash
php run-tests-simple.php  
```
- Basic test validation without PHPUnit
- Works in minimal environments
- Provides coverage estimation
- Validates core security components

### 3. Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Security tests only
composer run test-security

# API tests only  
composer run test-api

# Unit tests only
composer run test-unit
```

## Generated Reports

1. **HTML Coverage Report** → `coverage-php/index.html`
2. **Test Documentation** → `test-results/testdox.html`
3. **JUnit XML** → `test-results/phpunit-results.xml`
4. **Coverage Summary** → `TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md`

## Critical Security Components Tested

### Authorization Middleware (auth-middleware.php)
- ✅ Endpoint permissions matrix validation
- ✅ Role hierarchy enforcement
- ✅ Method-specific access controls  
- ✅ Whitelist-based security approach
- ✅ Performance optimization (1000 checks < 0.1s)

### Rate Limiting (rate-limiting.php)
- ✅ Per-endpoint rate limits configuration
- ✅ Sliding window algorithm implementation
- ✅ File-based cache with security
- ✅ HTTP 429 responses with proper headers
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

### CSRF Protection (csrf-middleware.php) 
- ✅ Cryptographically secure token generation
- ✅ Double-submit cookie pattern
- ✅ Origin/Referer validation
- ✅ Token lifetime management
- ✅ Attack simulation and prevention
