## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Tables Created
1. **`user_mfa_settings`** - MFA configuration and status per user
2. **`mfa_audit_log`** - Complete audit trail of MFA activities

### Modified Tables  
1. **`users`** - Added 7 MFA-related columns (encrypted secrets, timestamps)
2. **`global_settings`** - Added 5 MFA configuration columns

### Key Features
- All secrets encrypted with unique IVs
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity  
- Indexes for optimal performance
- Automatic cleanup procedures

## 🔧 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Authentication |
|----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/api/mfa-setup.php` | POST | Initialize MFA setup | Required |
| `/api/mfa-verify.php` | POST | Verify TOTP/backup codes | Required |
| `/api/mfa-backup-codes.php` | GET/POST | Manage backup codes | Required |
| `/api/login-with-mfa.php` | POST | Enhanced login with MFA | Session |

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC with unique IVs
- **Key Management**: Environment-based key storage
- **Scope**: TOTP secrets and backup codes encrypted separately
- **Key Rotation**: Supports key rotation without data loss

### Rate Limiting
- **Setup**: 3 attempts per hour per user
- **Verification**: 10 attempts per minute per user
- **Backup Access**: 5 attempts per hour per user
- **Lockout**: 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User logs in via Azure AD OAuth
2. System checks if MFA is required for user's role
3. If MFA enabled: Request TOTP/backup code
4. Verify code against encrypted stored secret
5. Log successful authentication
6. Grant access to application
```

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

### Encryption Key Management
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY must be:
- At least 32 characters long
- Unique and different from other application keys
- Securely stored and backed up
- Never committed to version control
- Rotated periodically

### Backup Code Security
⚠️ **WARNING**: Backup codes are:
- Single-use only (deleted after use)
- Encrypted in database
- Should be treated like passwords
- Need secure storage by users
- Can be regenerated if compromised

### Production Deployment
⚠️ **REQUIRED** for production:
- Enable rate limiting
- Configure proper logging
- Set up monitoring alerts
- Test backup/restore procedures
- Document emergency procedures

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### User Locked Out
```sql
-- Reset MFA lockout for user ID 123
UPDATE user_mfa_settings 
SET locked_until = NULL, failed_attempts = 0 
WHERE user_id = 123;
```

### Disable MFA for User
```sql
-- Emergency disable MFA for user ID 123
UPDATE users SET 
    mfa_enabled = 0,
    mfa_secret = NULL,
    mfa_secret_iv = NULL,
    mfa_backup_codes = NULL,
    mfa_backup_codes_iv = NULL
WHERE id = 123;

DELETE FROM user_mfa_settings WHERE user_id = 123;
```

### System Recovery
1. Check audit logs for security incidents
2. Verify encryption key availability
3. Test MFA functionality with test account
4. Monitor error logs for issues
5. Contact users if system-wide reset needed
