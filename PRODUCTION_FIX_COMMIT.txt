fix: Correct production deployment configuration

- Fix index.html to load built JavaScript bundle instead of TypeScript source
- Remove incorrect /src/index.tsx reference
- Update to use proper Vite build output paths
- Ensure production loads compiled assets from /assets/ directory

This fixes the NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT and 500 errors in production.
