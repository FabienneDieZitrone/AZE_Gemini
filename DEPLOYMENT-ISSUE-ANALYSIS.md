# FTP Deployment Issue Analysis

## Problem
FTP login fails with error 530 despite:
- SSL/TLS connection working correctly
- Using the credentials you confirmed work: `321Start321`
- Previous successful deployments documented

## Evidence of Working FTP
1. **FTP Test Report (2025-07-29)**: Shows FTP was "VOLL FUNKTIONSFÄHIG" (fully functional)
2. **Successful Deployment (2025-07-25)**: Complete deployment documented
3. Both reports confirm SSL/TLS was used successfully

## Current Situation
```
Server: wp10454681.server-he.de ✅
SSL/TLS: Working (TLS 1.3) ✅
User: ftp10454681-aze3 ✅
Password: 321Start321 ❌ (530 Login incorrect)
```

## Possible Causes
1. **Password has been changed** since the last successful deployment
2. **Account locked** due to failed login attempts
3. **IP restrictions** applied to the FTP account
4. **Different password** than what's documented

## Resolution Steps Needed
1. **Verify the current FTP password** in HostEurope control panel
2. **Check if account is locked** and needs to be unlocked
3. **Confirm no IP restrictions** are blocking our connection
4. **Test from HostEurope's web-based file manager** to confirm credentials

## Workaround Options
1. **Reset FTP password** in HostEurope control panel
2. **Use SFTP** if SSH access is available in your package
3. **Web-based file manager** for manual deployment
4. **Create new FTP user** if current one is problematic

The deployment scripts and security implementations are ready. Only the FTP authentication issue prevents deployment.
